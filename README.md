# Cube Animation and Design in Blender
Overview

This project demonstrates a technique for animating and designing cubes in Blender. It covers basic to advanced animation principles, including keyframe animation, shape keys, and modifiers. The project also explores different design styles and effects that can be achieved using cubes in Blender.

Features

Basic Cube Animation: Created simple animations using keyframes to move, rotate, and scale cubes.
Shape Keys: Used shape keys to morph cubes into different shapes and create complex animations.
Modifiers: Applied modifiers like Subdivision Surface and Array to enhance the design of cubes.
Materials and Textures: Applied and animated materials and textures to cubes for visual effects.
Camera and Lighting: Set up cameras and lighting to improve the presentation of animated cubes.
